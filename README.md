# SpaceX Landing Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9 boosters using machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes historical flight data, and the model is built using Jupyter Notebook and various data science libraries.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Deployment-ready Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-Shalan/SpaceX-Landing-Prediction.git
cd SpaceX-Landing-Prediction
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `SpaceX_Landing_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to see the data analysis and model training process.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from [SpaceX launch records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches). It includes:

- Flight number
- Booster version
- Payload mass
- Launch site
- Landing outcome

## Model

The machine learning model predicts whether the Falcon 9 booster will successfully land based on input features. Various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

## Results

The trained model achieves 88% accuracy in predicting the landing success. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters and adding more features.
